# Local Skill Swap

This website will power a hyperlocal skill-sharing platform, designed to connect individuals within a specific neighborhood or community. It functions as a modern barter system for knowledge and abilities, fostering genuine in-person interactions.

## How it Works

Users can offer to teach a skill (e.g., baking bread, playing guitar, basic coding) or request help with a task (e.g., gardening, minor home repairs, language tutoring). The core idea is to facilitate exchanges where one person's skill can be traded for another's, without the need for monetary transactions.

## Key Features

*   **Skill Listings:** Users can create profiles showcasing the skills they offer and the skills they are looking to learn or receive help with.
*   **Hyperlocal Focus:** The platform will emphasize connecting people within a very small, defined local area, encouraging face-to-face interactions and community building.
*   **Ratings & Reviews:** A system for users to rate and review their exchange partners, building trust and accountability within the community.
*   **Messaging System:** A simple, secure in-app messaging feature to allow users to discuss potential skill swaps, arrange meetings, and coordinate details.
*   **Search & Filters:** Robust search capabilities to find specific skills or users within the local area.

## Vision

The goal is to strengthen local communities by enabling neighbors to leverage each other's talents and knowledge, promoting a culture of sharing, learning, and mutual support.
